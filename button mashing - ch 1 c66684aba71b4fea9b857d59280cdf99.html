That&#x27;s jump.&quot; On-screen, Minho&#x27;s newly created avatar hopped up and down in place. </p><p id="ea460d1d-cbbd-47e0-b37b-caadefc8ffea" class="">&quot;Ah, Lix, don&#x27;t worry so much.&quot; Minho waved a hand dismissively, hurriedly placing it back on the keyboard when his character almost dashed off the top of a cliff. &quot;I&#x27;ll figure out the controls on my own, okay? Trial and error, or whatever. And then we can play together whenever you want.&quot;</p><p id="d18b68e0-cfda-4448-bfa9-cff5a5a8a859" class="">Felix squished his cheek into Minho&#x27;s shoulder, rubbing his face against his hoodie until his hair became a mess again. &quot;Okaaay.&quot;</p><p id="41e9c2ea-9f47-48a5-97ab-2a7782e4c764" class="">&quot;Go do your homework like a good little student, okay? I know you hate watching me play.&quot;</p><p id="bf17b2ff-6840-4cbb-b14e-d2d55ec85508" class="">&quot;Only because you won&#x27;t let me <em>help</em>,&quot; Felix complained. &quot;And you&#x27;re really bad, too. <em>And</em> classes literally just started, so I don&#x27;t even have homework.&quot;</p><p id="17286989-221f-4ee1-abf5-cfd99b1b298e" class="">Minho poked the freshman in the forehead, making him lose his balance. &quot;<em>Go</em>. I promise I&#x27;ll be decent enough to do that birthday quest with you, alright? And what&#x27;s the point of you grinding my character if I can&#x27;t familiarize myself with the controls, silly.&quot;</p><p id="656e50ea-3b2f-4029-9116-96004ac230ad" class="">Felix nodded glumly, still sulking. &quot;Fine then. I&#x27;ll go to the canteen and get some snacks. Want anything?&quot;</p><p id="9cf9941e-1ecd-4687-900d-51fb4581edf9" class="">Minho hummed in thought. &quot;Fried chicken? My wallet&#x27;s in the top drawer. No, wait, I can&#x27;t eat that and play at the same time. Just get me a drink.&quot;</p><p id="1f1661cc-7cca-4f10-9166-78bd468d1f69" class="">As Felix let himself out of their shared room, Minho turned back to his screen, frowning a little. Truth be told, he hadn&#x27;t been paying attention to Felix&#x27;s introductory spiel at all, and he may or may not have accidentally skipped through the tutorial. So now, with his little character standing in the middle of an open field, with no idea of which direction to move in, Minho was in a bit of a pickle.</p><p id="7d2e1471-4871-418e-aae0-da1af4037ccb" class="">It&#x27;s not like Minho had never played a game before in his life. He&#x27;d picked up Pokemon once or twice as a kid, watched occasionally as his classmates would crowd around a computer as someone played League, but he never quite understood the appeal. Real life was hectic enough, thank you very much, and Minho didn&#x27;t have time to micromanage a half-life in a false reality.</p><p id="0541f62e-a6ae-4ba1-a8c7-646eca791e64" class="">But Felix had batted his lashes, making his cherished request in such a pitiful kitten-like voice, that Minho had no choice but to acquiesce. The happy little cheer his underclassman let out immediately after had let him know he&#x27;d been scammed once again, but, well. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;d be a <em>bad</em> thing for Minho to learn what the kids were up to these days.</p><p id="5e0475fe-eb6a-41cb-a57d-3a0ee5a6781b" class="">The problem was, technology had progressed quite a bit farther since the last time he paid attention to digital entertainment, and this new style of gameplay was a tad bit overwhelming to the inexperienced Minho.</p><p id="cf8d4e1e-4897-40ae-a3c4-67f86cb7f19e" class="">&quot;Whatever, it&#x27;ll be fine,&quot; he muttered to himself, mousing around the screen and tapping random keys to figure out which button did what. Through trial and error and no insubstantial HP loss, Minho managed to uncover his inventory, his skills, his map, and a handful of menus, enough to have him feeling comfortable enough to move around.</p><p id="e31a0c0c-4cb2-4639-870b-b4c6d9d19c37" class="">This MMORPG (and Minho had already forgotten the name, if he was being honest) seemed to be a generic fantasy world, but to someone who had never played this genre of game before, it was quite exciting.</p><p id="48f6243a-fffe-4cb2-8790-4a8321bdbbb3" class="">The character creation process alone was very interesting to Minho, who had had a bit too much fun customizing his character&#x27;s physical features.</p><p id="5c8a141b-f680-4189-b2dc-173944498da2" class="">&quot;It&#x27;s for virtual reality,&quot; Felix had explained as he took careful pictures of Minho&#x27;s face from multiple angles. &quot;Your game character is unique to you, and it&#x27;s locked to your real face and identity in case they upgrade to VR. A lot of newer games have been messing with the technology lately, and this one&#x27;s kinda lagging behind in that regard, but there&#x27;s been rumors that they might update it soon.&quot;</p><p id="db71470c-606a-4fe1-8afe-f28aa603124a" class="">&quot;So you&#x27;re telling me to play an outdated junk game,&quot; Minho had teased him, fascinated by the way his face was fitted to the in-game avatar&#x27;s. It truly did look quite like him, if he had bright white hair and dressed like a medieval peasant.</p><p id="860023ca-eb4b-4ef0-ab26-1a59923880d6" class="">&quot;Noooo,&quot; Felix protested. &quot;It&#x27;s really fun, I swear, I promise you&#x27;ll like it.&quot;</p><p id="54dce408-8e32-4781-8035-93f6379cccff" class="">&quot;You wouldn&#x27;t let me add the cat ears on him.&quot;</p><p id="3e24f623-c09c-489f-ae16-ef1f23460ec5" class="">&quot;<em>Hyung</em>, demis have crappy stats. I&#x27;ll buy you a cat ears headband for your character later, okay? You can lock them to your character so they won’t drop even when you die,&quot; Felix wheedled.</p><p id="5ca73976-1f6f-460b-8a60-3ebb2637db7d" class="">Beyond his character, Minho had to admit the graphics of the game were stunning, if still a bit unrealistic, to the point of nearly overheating his computer. For now, he played on Felix&#x27;s fancy gaming laptop, since the younger was apparently looking for a new one soon.</p><p id="22577285-988e-480a-b677-85d2d6dbfd1f" class="">Minho angles his character to look down, admiring the way the grass actually remained crushed after he stomped all over it. This was quite fun in and of itself, but the squeal of a wild pig charging in his direction told him he&#x27;d be quickly learning how to fight.</p><hr id="3d777c2d-5db2-4bdc-b741-7322fb0ec6f4"/><p id="fd471b95-57e4-46ba-b798-a9ecf3927848" class="">&quot;Bro, where are you?&quot; Changbin barked out, voice so loud it sounded staticky even through Jisung&#x27;s new headphones.</p><p id="654a4064-513e-429f-9e0a-858b4d94153d" class="">&quot;I&#x27;m on my way, like I said the last 5 times you asked,&quot; Jisung complained. &quot;S&#x27;not my fault people spammed me as soon as I logged on. I even misclicked on where to teleport.&quot;</p><p id="4ffff389-6fd8-4175-bf89-a863cb08d0f1" class="">&quot;Not very humble of you to be complaining about how famous you are,&quot; Chan teased from the same voice channel. </p><p id="cf533c1c-a613-4594-bfd3-e8dfc5783c9a" class="">Jisung smirked, even though the others couldn&#x27;t see it. &quot;Well, we can&#x27;t <em>all</em> be the best player in the game.&quot;</p><p id="095c1286-8d6b-4d52-9d23-93e59c4d2e80" class="">&quot;Only in Korea,&quot; Changbin quipped grumpily, although Jisung knew he wasn&#x27;t being mean. &quot;Pretty sure you&#x27;d get your ass beat by the Americans.&quot;</p><p id="16fb4e16-525d-453a-a593-f36261786a5a" class="">Jisung stuck his tongue out.</p><p id="0d595385-eead-4476-927b-9b8c5dd58425" class="">&quot;And stop sticking your tongue out, you&#x27;re already ugly.&quot;</p><p id="1eb44379-d80d-416e-977b-4fe2506b753f" class="">Jisung rolled his eyes as he swiftly clicked towards the correct portal. &quot;Are you two still at the office, hyung?&quot;</p><p id="ce8910e7-24e3-41b4-b7d7-951ce00e9a33" class="">&quot;Yeah,&quot; came Chan&#x27;s reply. &quot;There was no way we&#x27;d get home in time before the dungeon closed.&quot;</p><p id="791164cf-c423-4662-85c8-8058f4f60318" class="">Jisung hummed in understanding. Maybe if he took a shortcut through the Adventurer&#x27;s Prairie, he&#x27;d shave a few seconds off his journey. Usually he avoided that place like a plague, but scrolling through the world chat where his previous location had been leaked, it seemed like everyone&#x27;s attention had been successfully diverted.</p><p id="cb08e5af-4e9e-4747-a10e-d225539dd0fc" class="">&quot;Whew,&quot; Jisung muttered to himself, dashing across the open plains. It&#x27;d been a long time since he&#x27;d come back here. Even now, with the game&#x27;s newbie influx in decline, there still seemed to be some people dutifully whacking at the low-level Feral Hogs.</p><p id="e3138805-4e02-47c0-ac94-d68787e21701" class=""><em>Cute</em>, he thought in passing at one rather attractive guy, before sliding into the portal just as it was about to close.</p><hr id="2d2e66ba-7c87-4069-a5cd-4f8fdf4cc665"/><p id="6e295d2c-c723-4d24-8f21-bf111d667248" class="">&quot;Hyung, you&#x27;re still here? Sorry I&#x27;m late, there was a line.&quot; Felix garbled through a mouthful of pork bun, toeing the door shut.</p><p id="684f3d4c-ac7f-4785-abc2-d9c3e8177c24" class="">&quot;You didn&#x27;t tell me they drop meat,&quot; Minho accused without turning around, eyes focused on his screen where his avatar was fighting yet another pig mob with his wooden sword.</p><p id="a6c78ab7-99a1-4f8f-a35b-255c2bfe6898" class="">Felix leaned in over his shoulder, squinting at his stats. &quot;Hyung, have you even taken any quests? Whoa, did you level up just from fighting Feral Hogs alone?&quot;</p><p id="02d6b983-b1be-454a-94f0-daaae62815a1" class="">Minho shrugged. &quot;Dunno.&quot; Right as he spoke, his character&#x27;s sword shattered. &quot;Oh, no.&quot;</p><p id="efedefa3-c511-4f21-b14e-11cb448d0b63" class="">&quot;Ah yeah, you have to make sure you take care of your weapon&#x27;s durability. But you really wore it down so fast?&quot;</p><p id="89371358-949d-4ddc-8e94-4fbf7cc2739c" class="">&quot;There was a lot of bacon.&quot; Minho gestured for Felix to pass him his drink. &quot;Can I do anything with the meat?&quot;</p><p id="2a18b1ed-6011-485b-a5eb-b1e2e137fcea" class="">&quot;Mm, I think there&#x27;s a cooking function, but it&#x27;s pretty useless.&quot; Felix looked up, lost in thought. &quot;You&#x27;d be better off running around looking for villagers who have quests that can take your meat, &#x27;cause then you can at least get paid and buy another weapon. Fighting without a sword is kinda... Hyung,&quot; Felix broke off exasperatedly, as Minho had immediately stopped paying attention and gone back to trying to punch the mob.</p><p id="a9818764-fc8e-4f4c-b20f-063965e36815" class="">&quot;Whoa, this is cool. What a shitty stance, though.&quot;</p><p id="e177fb5d-9ba1-4b4e-8359-cb63e5f5d99a" class="">&quot;Of course you&#x27;d like that, you boxing maniac,&quot; Felix muttered.</p><hr id="6abc29f8-2b11-44ca-8a48-089733b18e6a"/><p id="ae90ac85-6d62-4ffa-802e-c1bc12bd6799" class="">&quot;Whoa, thanks hyung!&quot; Jisung exclaimed delightedly, scrolling through his drops. &quot;I almost have enough to upgrade my boots again.&quot;</p><p id="73b70ac4-8094-4016-a847-dd5edb99823a" class="">&quot;That&#x27;s why we came here, Sung,&quot; Chan replied warmly. &quot;Bin and I are going to come home now, so we&#x27;ll see you soon, alright?&quot;</p><p id="c7d80fe3-90ae-4260-b5c6-f934cb07ff2c" class="">&quot;Changbin&#x27;s staying over again tonight? Don&#x27;t you have your own McMansion, hyung? Should&#x27;ve never moved out in the first place,&quot; Jisung teased, quickly selling some of his unneeded loot.</p><p id="8959e2ae-e249-4d02-a28d-c3827b6d0a0b" class="">&quot;Shut it,&quot; Changbin grumbled. &quot;Or I&#x27;m not going to buy that new couch for you.&quot;</p><p id="c23e18d2-bd8b-49f3-a502-48149907b514" class="">&quot;You get the most out of it either way, you&#x27;re the one who has to sleep on it.&quot;</p><p id="0b86ec90-fd3d-470e-888e-7de835d3208e" class="">&quot;Anyways,&quot; Changbin continued loudly, ignoring Chan&#x27;s laughter in the back, &quot;we have to go over some of the new designs ahead of holiday season. So I might as well just stay over.&quot;</p><p id="e3bad518-1eba-42b5-a5aa-88b236f570dd" class="">&quot;That&#x27;s like three months away,&quot; Jisung complained.</p><p id="bdcca436-2581-4fd6-ac88-40de958c3eed" class="">&quot;We can&#x27;t procrastinate manufacturing the way you do the designs, Jisung.&quot;</p><p id="ba2cd6aa-0d91-494f-bdea-51078a71c75f" class="">&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Jisung muttered. &quot;Okay, I&#x27;m gonna waste some time and solo a dungeon or something. Drive safely, hyung.&quot;</p><p id="6f4bb55b-2dda-4bf0-b3e4-888a0e0a9c9d" class="">&quot;Bye.&quot;</p><p id="117e8d25-36ba-4ed0-87aa-5b29688f7b55" class="">As much as he enjoyed teaming up with his best friends, there was still something comforting about the headspace Jisung got into when he played alone, when he didn&#x27;t have to waste energy thinking about how to communicate his plays to other people, the particular rhythm between his movements and the sounds of his mouse clicking.</p><p id="fc383abc-427a-4ec0-b6e3-3017cb214993" class="">This time, Jisung didn&#x27;t worry too much about the completion time of his run. Since he was getting through it alone, of course his time would be far from the top of the leaderboard; he mainly wanted to play something familiar.</p><p id="51599cbb-2a0b-4e96-96b2-c3eaa5fb0e47" class="">Without the need to concentrate too much on his every move, Jisung&#x27;s thoughts wandered. This was his favorite part of gaming, when his hands could fidget enough on autopilot to leave his brain empty in a focused way without truly zoning out, and despite how everyone else perceived him, this was when he felt like he was the most productive.</p><p id="bf8aef76-9a20-4d2a-b263-223eab298971" class="">In his head, Jisung mentally shuffled through some ideas for the designs Chan and Changbin would be expecting, even as his hands moved agilely across the keyboard, scores of mobs dying under his accurate movements. The older two had dropped out partway through university to run a wildly successful merchandise line, with the goal to eventually expand into a full trademarked brand one day. They’d already gone viral a few times on social media, but they were still firmly in the ‘cult following’ tier and hadn’t truly broken through to mainstream popularity yet. That might take years, if not decades. </p><p id="eead66fa-52b4-4101-a939-0b42f603f25a" class="">While Chan was responsible for most of their marketed characters, quirky cartoon doodles brought to life in the form of plushies and plastered across other products, Jisung had been the one responsible for most of the product designs. It&#x27;d been his idea for a dino-shaped coffee maker that had earned them their first million from a single product, and after that, the ideas had never stopped coming.</p><p id="1593bb41-0a78-4159-98ab-bb1506586d81" class="">Jisung huffed. His hyungs wouldn&#x27;t let him quit school to work full-time for them though, stating their concerns that it&#x27;d do him more good to be around people other than just them two, along with the benefits a good education generally brought. Joke&#x27;s on them, though, when Jisung tended to stay aloof even while gaming. Despite being a notorious ranker, his friend list wasn&#x27;t even halfway full: Jisung’s usual response when other top players asked to stay in touch was that they could simply friend Chan or Changbin if they wanted to get in contact with him. The three of them were inseparable, and both his hyungs were far better at remembering to navigate social niceties than him.</p><p id="a73f86de-ccdf-4755-bbd5-a043b4735ef5" class="">Sighing with relief at the completion notification, Jisung settled back into his chair as he began to make his way back across the continent. Figuring no one saw him besides that one guy, he decided to cut through Adventurer&#x27;s Prairie again.</p><p id="6993ac6d-968a-4662-8b08-d3604297343b" class="">To his surprise, the same player was still there, although now he was fighting barehanded against the mobs. Jisung glanced over at his clock. It had already been more than an hour and a half since he had first saw the guy: he must have broken his beginner&#x27;s sword already.</p><p id="d24ef07a-5663-4b5b-ac73-154582491187" class="">Jisung couldn&#x27;t help smiling a bit as he clicked on the other player&#x27;s status. He wasn&#x27;t sure if the Level 7 &quot;soondoongdo&quot; was hardworking or simply clueless, but he thought he&#x27;d offer a bit of encouragement nonetheless, especially since he was rich enough to be generous. </p><hr id="cc646b80-2509-4981-b393-46ee1832ab23"/><p id="12759bc6-9f41-445e-b09b-ea4000573b85" class="">&quot;Uh, hyung. How long has J.One been there?&quot; Felix had gotten bored watching Minho minutes after coming back from the canteen and had been sighing over his homework ever since, but now the younger boy&#x27;s head was hooked over Minho&#x27;s shoulder like he&#x27;d never left.</p><p id="e75b09fd-9b5b-4d2a-b477-352993afd2a6" class="">Minho glanced at the corner of his screen. &quot;Not long.&quot; He&#x27;d noticed the other player as soon as he&#x27;d run up, considering that was the only other player he&#x27;d seen this entire time. It was hard not to notice J.One, flashy as he was.</p><p id="ad70b036-2849-4993-a69a-d90e0cda2cb3" class="">Not only did the other character have his nickname scrawled in some fancy script that shot off firework sparks every few seconds, the avatar itself was dressed in some sort of ostentatious armor that looked one match away from lighting itself on fire. Minho would almost be impressed if there wasn&#x27;t a tantalizing promise of bacon headbutting him in the chest at the moment.</p><p id="58cf47fc-2038-457f-9661-7b097dc750ac" class="">If the other guy had said something, maybe Minho would&#x27;ve tried to respond (not that he&#x27;d found the controls for that yet). But since he&#x27;d stopped by, the other player had done nothing but stand there facing him. Minho had promptly turned around and gone right back to punching pigs.</p><p id="c28129d1-eb21-4d6c-b0b0-e5ad12a2121f" class="">&quot;Hyung,&quot; Felix breathed. &quot;That&#x27;s the top player on this server. Is he just <em>watching </em>you?&quot;</p><p id="8c1a3341-292b-4886-99be-fec1819f6bad" class="">&quot;I must have better fighting technique than him, of course he&#x27;d watch.&quot;</p><p id="78bb1580-16b1-4a3e-bf0b-9c0e0b195692" class="">&quot;Hyung, <em>no</em>,&quot; Felix whined at Minho&#x27;s playful cockiness. &quot;Oh my god, stop fighting for a second and pan back to him. What does he want?&quot;</p><p id="e7adfd86-7f98-4fad-9107-f72f6dcc991a" class="">&quot;What&#x27;s it matter to you?&quot; Minho retorted but complied. He couldn&#x27;t deny being a little bit curious, too.</p><p id="6dcccc39-e23b-4c43-8b29-11ac3681bd52" class="">&quot;Wait, stop, by the grass. Oh my god, did he drop an S-grade health potion for <em>you</em>?&quot; Felix shrieked right in his ear, voice jumping up five octaves. &quot;Pick it up! Hyung, pick it up!&quot;</p><p id="c69b7ea8-a792-404a-8577-3ee1384908bf" class="">&quot;What? <em>How?</em>&quot;</p><p id="cba4a7c2-c6d8-4dd5-95fd-13ee45f47676" class="">&quot;Same key as when you picked up all the drops!

For <em>carrots</em>? It was a refreshing change from the way players always treated him whenever he partied with them for raids and dungeons. People would either try to latch onto him in order to strengthen themselves, giving out insincere compliments, or they&#x27;d try to prove they were better than him somehow. The constant challenges were really annoying, especially since those types of assholes always had an excuse for losing the first few times he had reluctantly accepted.

He wondered if his cheeks were that round in real life.</p><p id="1bbdccb6-ac5c-4f87-ba17-6900a828751d" class="">Before he could reply, all the lights in their room went out, and Felix&#x27;s laptop screen grayed out as the internet shut off, disconnecting them from the game. &quot;Ah.&quot;</p><p id="6b4b6be7-c575-4334-bef4-e10a1f1fbb61" class="">&quot;Oh no, we left him hanging,&quot; Felix panicked, but Minho wasn&#x27;t worried.</p><p id="57f52d3e-2a7e-4d47-912b-daf21a88be14" class="">&quot;It&#x27;s fine, we&#x27;ll see him again.&quot; Minho had no idea how true his words were going to be.</p><hr id="28db3f3c-dbdb-4138-8c7a-e6d478e6fafb"/><p id="cff5ef85-98bd-4b7e-8538-4f00f1f98aff" class="">Jisung&#x27;s headphones were brusquely yanked off his head. &quot;Hey!&quot; He protested, whirling around in his chair to face a smugly grinning Changbin. &quot;Give those back!&quot;</p><p id="71e512c2-6077-45ef-b519-45d4a5be9df7" class="">&quot;Nope, Chan-hyung said I could.&quot;</p><p id="869ac59e-76aa-48c9-86e6-652041efe639" class="">&quot;What? That&#x27;s not fair!&quot; Jisung whined. &quot;<em>Hyung—</em>&quot;</p><p id="1822b2b8-91b9-4601-98ec-76be8032570f" class="">&quot;You left the front door unlocked,&quot; Chan called from the kitchen as the other two tromped out of Jisung&#x27;s room. The oldest was bent over in the kitchen, rummaging through grocery bags at his feet. &quot;One of these days we&#x27;re going to get robbed if you don&#x27;t pay attention.&quot;</p><p id="84fe5ca8-8450-43f8-83e9-a9608389ed76" class=""><em>Smack</em>. </p><p id="19ff0972-223b-4982-b485-69e57310511b" class="">&quot;Oi!&quot; Chan straightened up, frowning in exasperation as he rubbed one hand over his ass. &quot;That hurt this time.&quot;</p><p id="905bcfc5-27a5-4d9f-81ad-dd1b5d3e8a37" class="">&quot;Sorry, couldn&#x27;t resist,&quot; Changbin replied cheekily. &quot;Want me to kiss it better?&quot;</p><p id="482bf4fa-a2ad-42d8-96f1-36030a2441fd" class="">&quot;Gross.&quot; Jisung wrinkled his nose. &quot;Can&#x27;t you guys flirt somewhere else?&quot;</p><p id="1d9ad188-f9c1-42aa-b6ea-99dbd1a35e06" class="">&quot;Awww, you know you want some of this.&quot; Changbin made a kissy face, puckering his lips exaggeratedly and chasing Jisung out of the kitchen.</p><p id="ec0053c0-33e6-491c-9e42-dd8e2a4d3088" class="">Chan sighed, left alone once again to set out dinner on his own.</p><p id="03c66db7-86f2-424f-86ec-fb1b5d25e0c4" class="">
</p><p id="60cdfd81-d06e-4f81-a574-05b31e8b67da" class="">&quot;So what did you get up to while we were out?&quot; Changbin asked, nudging Jisung while trying to steal a piece of meat from his bowl at the same time. &quot;I saw you solo&#x27;d that dungeon, but you were still playing when we got back.&quot;</p><p id="e21dcd79-5d6e-4559-9b1d-35ae629c0ce6" class="">Jisung hesitated. Changbin was always perceptive, and sometimes scarily protective of Jisung, so he wasn&#x27;t sure how he&#x27;d react, but well... &quot;Actually, I was partying with someone.&quot;</p><p id="7f91effa-3b38-4b61-b8c1-8570e3e8015b" class="">&quot;Oh?&quot; Chan leaned forward, setting his phone down on the table from where he&#x27;d been checking emails. &quot;With one of the Blackbeard guys?&quot; It made sense that he’d assume it was Hongjoong’s guild, considering they were the closest acquaintances Jisung had outside of his own guild’s officers. Jisung wasn’t sure how he felt about telling Chan he was wrong, but he shook his head slowly.</p><p id="d76fd186-61d0-4974-880a-23565aa42ea7" class="">Changbin’s eyes lit up, interested. “The Fab Five?” Referring to a particularly feisty gaggle of guildmates.</p><p id="bf07f609-bb89-4b62-849a-2f00acab73c7" class="">“Nope, uh, heh.” Jisung couldn’t stifle the awkward laugh. “I actually came across some new player when I cut back through the beginner’s prairie, and kiiiinda helped him hunt in the Forest of Beasts?”</p><p id="6ce2d610-fc7c-476c-ad7b-b86904c7d1e8" class="">Okay, those stares were <em>very</em> warranted.</p><p id="28e86b4a-c51f-4d6e-be53-49410a5e2ae6" class="">“You carried a noob?” Jisung wanted to wince prematurely at Changbin’s shock, but he was pleasantly surprised. “Dude, that’s wild!”</p><p id="b8bb83e8-1808-4117-9c74-49e6fbd71a7e" class="">Chan smiled warmly at him, too. “I’m glad you’re making new friends, Sung. Did he ask you for help or something?”</p><p id="3f8d0bb1-27c2-4ab7-a95f-6309e0127fc3" class="">“Actually, he didn’t even notice I was there.” Jisung proceeded to retell how his afternoon had gone, unaware of how animated his gestures were growing as he described Soondoongdo’s fascinating personality.</p><p id="c1d1841a-b61b-4d92-b4ef-58a03b3a32fe" class="">“What a strange dude.” Truly, that didn’t even begin to cover the guy’s eccentricity. “You don’t think he’ll take advantage of you though, will he?”</p><p id="6f9b531f-744b-454e-b3da-83cb6c308905" class="">Jisung shook his head furiously. Sure, it was always a possibility, but Soondoongdo had seemed completely blasé about Jisung’s rank, even after his friend had presumably explained who he was. If anything, <em>Jisung </em>was the one chasing the other guy down. It was clear that SDD was playing the game exactly how he wanted to, caring nothing for any sort of optimization to level up his character as quickly as possible: it was the purest form of enjoyment, and Jisung admired him for it.</p><p id="eb1242d5-012b-4eb0-9f8a-638663c01062" class="">“He just seemed, like. Cool, I guess,” Jisung admitted timidly. “We’re going to hunt more tomorrow.” He wouldn’t get his hopes up, since he knew how frequently online plans could fall through, but it was nobody’s business if he maybe hung around in Mistral just a bit longer.</p><p id="10007cf7-d6fa-4811-96ea-7b3e38c83a3e" class="">“Sounds like you’ll have a good time, then. Let us know if he needs someone who’s actually capable of carrying,” Changbin teased, reaching over the table to ruffle Jisung’s hair.</p><p id="32856e8b-603b-4814-9cd3-e8a2e526b118" class="">“Hey!”</p><hr id="938432fc-5797-4916-a288-d17c7472844e"/><p id="df45e59c-8e56-407b-b69d-020acabd78d6" class="">Minho’s had a shit day, honestly. First, the A/C in the practice building was broken, so he was soaked with sweat head to toe before he’d even finished warming up. Then, the practice session itself was rough, with so many do-overs that even sunny little Felix’s smile had faded. And then, to cap it all off, the football team had asked him to sub in for a pickup game against their rival school because one of their players had sprained his knee or something, and Minho was too, well, <em>nice</em> was the wrong word, but he was too <em>magnanimous</em> to turn them down. At least it wouldn’t cut into his studies too much, since his professor was currently on maternity leave and the lab was near-idle in her absence.</p><p id="60838ec3-ca26-4206-bd30-ce3478e452fa" class="">Minho sighed as he fell into his chair back in his room. It was his only admission that things weren’t going well today. His eyes fell on Felix’s laptop, and he was reminded of yesterday, when the other boy had introduced him to that game. </p><p id="9b93ebeb-c607-488b-bbc2-a8a834726a2d" class="">He’d told the fire guy he’d play with him, right? He had honestly planned on not showing up, seeing how his day had gone, but now the idea of whacking monsters over and over again had a certain appeal to it.  Minho glanced over at the clock. They had an hour before curfew, and bloodthirsty murder was always satisfying.</p><p id="119cf323-c2a0-4c72-82de-2c35b342570f" class="">“Yo, brownie boy,” he called out over his shoulder to the immobile lump curled up in one of the bunks. Felix was just as sore as he was and had opted to just give up on acting human for the night.</p><p id="61b14348-180d-45df-89d4-14a0fa85fbce" class="">“Mmph.”</p><p id="b04a26d1-ef03-49b2-bd08-f25db1a9753a" class="">“Can I borrow your computer? Gonna play with that guy from yesterday.”</p><p id="2a67d4ed-22fa-42e4-885b-8554cbd1756f" class="">“Mm.” A low groan, before the words hit Felix’s only working brain cell and he flew upright, eyes wide. “Wait, J.One?”</p><p id="aaba6dfb-adaa-4a5d-b603-7ad357c42bc1" class="">Minho stared at him, unimpressed. “Sure.”</p><p id="6dbb9365-c074-4fae-ab4b-c8ee856b7a13" class="">“<em>Yes</em>, oh my god, let me watch!”</p><p id="fd3cdd1e-e3e3-45a7-9060-53ea5de94526" class="">So now here they were, spawning again in the Forest of Beasts, where Minho immediately set to work eradicating the local bunny population. One glance at the in-game clock told him that he was a bit earlier than expected for their very vague rendezvous, but <a href="http://J.One">J.One</a> showed up a few minutes later, still earlier than they’d played together last time.</p><pre id="963b3506-bb6f-48be-bebe-9eb41c7f4791" class="code"><code>Whisper:

Originally, he had planned on teasing the other guy a bit, maybe saying that he truthfully <em>hadn’t</em> planned on showing up, but that would probably be a bad move. It was… warming, that this very experienced player seemed to be so concerned about him when he probably had more interesting things he could be doing in-game.</p><pre id="9286d843-d793-4057-b21e-54127959e468" class="code"><code>Whisper:

Since he didn’t need to control his character as <a href="http://J.One">J.One</a> breezily took out the mobs ahead of them in a continuous string of long-range attacks, he found himself zoning out as their avatars dashed through the woods and eradicated the local wildlife.</p><p id="43fae4a5-f11a-42d6-8756-68e1b6768bee" class="">Soon enough, they had traveled through the forest and stopped in front of a farm on the top of a gentle slope.
